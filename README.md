# Avoin Sans

Avoin is an open source font project. The typeface is a humanistic neo-grotesque, with rigorous geometry and generous round shapes.

The starting point for Avoin, was a font licensing problem in the City of Helsinki, which made it unfeasible to consistently use the font chosen for their visual identity (in the '90s). As the city was in the middle of renewing both internal and external communications the font was intended to serve as an bridge between a new marketing concept and the old communications materials that had not been refreshed for decades. Since 2014, Helsinki has been using a version of this font, called Helsinki Avoin Sans.

For a long time now this underlying open source project has not moved anywhere, but now it's time to get going again.
